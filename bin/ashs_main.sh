		ashs_main: automatic segmentation of hippocampal subfields
		usage:
		  ashs_main [options]

		required options:
		  -a dir            Location of the atlas directory. Can be a full pathname or a
		                    relative directory name under ASHS_ROOT/data directory. 
		  -g image          Filename of 3D (g)radient echo MRI (ASHS_MPRAGE, T1w)
		  -f image          Filename of 2D focal (f)ast spin echo MRI (ASHS_TSE, T2w)
		  -w path           Working/output directory

		optional:
		  -d                Enable debugging
		  -h                Print help
		  -s integer        Run only one stage (see below); also accepts range (e.g. -s 1-3)
		  -N                No overriding of ANTS/FLIRT results. If a result from an earlier run
		                    exists, don't run ANTS/FLIRT again
		  -T                Tidy mode. Cleans up files once they are unneeded. The -N option will
		                    have no effect in tidy mode, because ANTS/FLIRT results will be erased.
		  -I string         Subject ID (for stats output). Defaults to last word of working dir.
		  -V                Display version information and exit
		  -C file           Configuration file. If not passed, uses $ASHS_ROOT/bin/ashs_config.sh
		  -Q                Use Sun Grid Engine (SGE) to schedule sub-tasks in each stage. By default,
		                    the whole ashs_main job runs in a single process. If you are doing a lot
		                    of segmentations and have SGE, it is better to run each segmentation 
		                    (ashs_main) in a separate SGE job, rather than use the -q flag. The -q flag
		                    is best for when you have only a few segmentations and want them to run fast.
		  -q OPTS           Pass in additional options to SGE's qsub. Also enables -Q option above.
		  -z script         Provide a path to an executable script that will be used to retrieve SGE or
		                    GNU parallel options for different stages of ASHS. Takes precendence over -q
		  -P                Use GNU parallel to run on multiple cores on the local machine. You need to
		                    have GNU parallel installed.
		  -r files          Compare segmentation results with a reference segmentation. The parameter
		                    files should consist of two nifti files in quotation marks:

		                      -r "ref_seg_left.nii.gz ref_seg_right.nii.gz"

		                    The results will include overlap calculations between different
		                    stages of the segmentation and the reference segmentation. Note that the
		                    comparison takes into account the heuristic rules specified in the altas, so
		                    it is not as simple as computing dice overlaps between the reference seg
		                    and the ASHS segs.
		  -m file           Provide the .mat file for the transform between the T1w and T2w image. The file
		                    is in the format used by ITK-SNAP and C3D and should be generated by performing
		                    registration with the T2w MRI as fixed image and the T1w MRI as moving. 
		                    By default, the mat file is used as a hint to initialize rigid T2/T1
		                    but this can be modified with the -M flag.
		  -M                The mat file provided with -m is used as the final T2/T1 registration.
		                    ASHS will not attempt to run registration between T2 and T2.
		  -H                Tell ASHS to use external hooks for reporting progress, errors, and warnings.
		                    The environment variables ASHS_HOOK_SCRIPT must be set to point to the appropriate
		                    script. For an example script with comments, see ashs_default_hook.sh
		                    The purpose of the hook is to allow intermediary systems (e.g. XNAT) 
		                    to monitor ASHS performance. An optional ASHS_HOOK_DATA variable can be set
		  -B                Do not perform the bootstrapping step, and use the output of the initial joint
		                    label fusion (in multiatlas directory) as the final output.
		                    and will be forwarded to the script
		Stages:
		  1:                fit to population template
		  2:                multi-atlas registration
		  3:                consensus segmentation using voting
		  4:                bootstrap registration
		  5:                bootstrap segmentation using voting
		  6:                segmentation Q/A
		  7:                volumes and statistics

		Environment Variables:
		  ASHS_ROOT         Path to the ASHS root directory
		  ASHS_HOOK_XXX     See documentation for -H above

		Misc Notes:
		  The ASHS_TSE image slice direction should be z. In other words, the dimension
		  of ASHS_TSE image should be 400x400x30 or something like that, not 400x30x400

		SGE Options:
		  You can have detailed control over SGE options by passing a custom shell script to the -z
		  option. ASHS will call this shell script with the working directory as the first parameter
		  and stage as the second parameter. The script should print to stdout the SGE (qsub) options
		  that should be used for this stage. This allows you to allocate resources for each stage.
